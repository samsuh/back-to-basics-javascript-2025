# back-to-basics-javascript-2025

The purpose of this repository is to track my review of javascript fundamentals while going over a javascript basics course on udemy. This repository will contain folders with different small objectives, and some notes I've taken on the topics.

This is to be a part of a series of "back to basics" reviews this year to reinforce my fundamentals and familiarity with what's available for tools in my stack.
