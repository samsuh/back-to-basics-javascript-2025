# back-to-basics-javascript-2025

The purpose of this repository is to track my review of javascript fundamentals while going over a javascript basics course on udemy. This repository will contain folders with different small objectives, and some notes I've taken on the topics.

This is to be a part of a series of "back to basics" reviews this year to reinforce my fundamentals and familiarity with what's available for tools in my stack.

## Running javascript from files

text editor. make a .js file. make html file. run a script inside html file to run js. open html file in browser.

content in the js file will be evaluated, but you cannot see the outputs as you could in a REPL environment like the browser console. must use `console.log()` to get that behavior

console.log()
console.error()
can include many things in one console log separated by commas. itll log with spaces in between.
